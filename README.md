# Shock Elasticities Toolbox (MATLAB)

The Shock Elasticities Toolbox is a set of user-friendly functions that allow you to compute shock elasticities (for a full discussion on shock elasticities, please refer to [Borovicka and Hansen (2012)](https://www.borovicka.org/files/research/shock_elasticities_and_impulse_responses.pdf) and [Borovicka and Hansen (2016)](http://larspeterhansen.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/macroterm_main.pdf)). Currently, the toolbox is available in MATLAB. Equivalents in Python, R and Julia are forthcoming. 

## Installation and Usage
The toolbox has a very detailed [documentation](/main.pdf) and examples. Please use it as a guide.

As a quick start, complete sections 2.1 and 2.2 in the documentation. Afterwards, simply run

```matlab
HeKrushnamurthy
```

in MATLAB. It will compute shock elasticities for a one-dimensional model based on He and Krushnamurthy (2013).

## Live Script

In a [live MATLAB script](http://larspeterhansen.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DVD_Example.html), we use the toolbox to compute shock elasticities for Bansal and Yaron (2004) in a [research reflection](http://larspeterhansen.org/news/article/dynamic-value-decompositions/), which showcases the use of the toolbox and the intuitive interpretation of shock elasticities.
